# KStrongBarrier

This repository includes experimental data, data visualization and experimental results of the proposin algorithm in the manuscript "An efficient approach to the $k$-strong barrier coverage problem under the probabilistic sensing model in wireless multimedia sensor network".

## The folder Data and Visualization

The folder Data includes all the data generated to investigate the performance of the propsed algorithm, which is KSB-EA, and to compare with the state-of-the-art workings, which are KCES and AIPSO.

The data files are named after the number of static sensors NS, half of the sensing angle A (in small-scale networks) and the sensor distribution of the network (which is UNI for uniform, GAU for normal/gaussian or EXP for exponential distribution). The folders named W100-H020 includes data of small-scale networks while the folders named W500-H100 includes data of large-scale ones.
